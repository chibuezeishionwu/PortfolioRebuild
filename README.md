# Portfolio Rebuild

This is the Portfolio Rebuild project due 02-08-2024.

## Description

In this project, I showed advanced CSS styling by implementing CSS in various ways including:

Mobile Responsiveness (Media Queries),
CSS Positioning and Layout,
Utilization of CSS Grid and
CSS Variables. The inclusion of this basic README.md document was also a requirement.
