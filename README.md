# Portfolio Rebuild - The Repository

This repository is where most of my projects for the DTTP Web Development course is stored. I will update the repository often with new projects as they come.

## Projects

The projects are also accessible via hyperlinks in the projects section of the portfolio page.

### Portfolio Rebuild

This was my main portfolio page project. In this project, I showed advanced CSS styling by implementing CSS in various ways including:

* Mobile Responsiveness (Media Queries),
* CSS Positioning and Layout,
* Utilization of CSS Grid and
* CSS Variables. 

The inclusion of this basic README.md document was also a requirement.
Here is a screenshot of my portfolio page:

### Code Quiz

In this project, I used advanced JavaScript techniques to build a timed quiz that saves the highscore after the user is done with the quiz. Some of the JavaScript techniques used included:

* Timeouts and Intervals
* Managing the DOM via the JS Web API
* Creating and using functions
* Accessing the local storage
* Creating and using event listeners
